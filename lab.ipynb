    "In this lab, you will work with the classic **MNIST** dataset (handwritten digits). Unlike Lab 0 (Iris), where we had high-level features (petal length, etc.), here we work with **raw pixels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "1.  **Explore the data**: Understand how images are represented as vectors (Flattening).\n",
    "2.  **Normalize data**: Implement simple scaling and understand why it helps distance-based algorithms.\n",
    "3.  **Visualise high-dimensional data**: Use unsupervised learning algorithm UMAP for dimensionality reduction to see how 784-dimensional data looks in 2D.\n",
    "4.  **Train KNN**: Build a classifier for handwritten digits.\n",
    "5.  **Look inside the box**: Visualize the actual \"neighbors\" the model uses to make decisions.\n",
    "6.  **Break the model**: Test how robust the model is to simple pixel shifts.\n",

    "### 2.2 Task 2: Feature Scaling (Normalization) - 1 point\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Why do we need scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms, especially those based on **distance** (like KNN, K-Means, or SVMs), are very sensitive to the scale of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a dataset with two features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age:** 20 to 80 years.\n",
    "2. **Salary:** 10,000 to 200,000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "When KNN calculates the **Euclidean Distance** between two people:\n",
    "$$d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(Age_1 - Age_2)^2 + (Salary_1 - Salary_2)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A small difference in Salary (e.g., $1000) will square to 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large difference in Age (e.g., 50 years) will square to only 2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Result:** The algorithm will completely ignore \"Age\" because \"Salary\" numbers are just bigger. The model becomes biased toward features with larger magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we bring all features to the same scale. We move **from absolute values of feature - to it's variance**, and actually, the **variance is a fuel for ML**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Common Types of Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main techniques used in Data Science:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms features to fit within a specific range, usually **[0, 1]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{norm} = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Standardization (Z-Score Normalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms data so that it has a **mean ($\\mu$) of 0** and a **standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of 1**. This is the most common type of normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.3 What we use for Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital images consists of pixels. In a grayscale image (like MNIST), every pixel is an integer between **0 (black)** and **255 (white)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the minimum and maximum values are fixed and known ($min=0, max=255$), **Min-Max Scaling** is the standard approach for image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula simplifies significantly:\n",
    "$$X_{norm} = \\frac{X - 0}{255 - 0} = \\frac{X}{255}$$\n",
    "\n",
